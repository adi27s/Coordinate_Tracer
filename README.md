# Coordinate Tracing and Obstacle Avoiding Robotic Car

Crude model to understand the basics of localization and mapping using Arduino microcontroller which also performs obstacle avoidance.<br>
The model uses an Odometric Sensor(LM393), Ultrasonic Sensor(HCSR04), and BT Module.

It also follows a simple path-planning algorithm mentioned below.
